welcome to work on either pass but please work in only one of them so that
each page gets seen by two individuals for the round. Give particular attention to
subtle errors, such as stealth scannos and comma/period errors.</p>

<hr>

<p>This large study of the Tagalog language contains a number of folk-lore stories, their translation, and a long prose explanation of the grammar. The work is completed with an extensive glossary (or small dictionary).

<p>I've marked it hard, because if you happen to get a full page in Tagalog, you'll spend a good 10-20 minutes on it.

<p>The Tagalog text is written in phonetic transcription, and differs somewhat from the normal orthography. Most important is the use the grave and acute accents (different from their current use in Tagalog dictionaries); and two special letters (&#331; and†&#704;), for the ng sound and the glottal stop respectively. Please proof the first as [n,] and the second as ^?. (The OCR mostly turned the &#331; into a g, and the &#704; into a 9; unfortunately the &#331; is very common. Proofing hint: copy [n,] into your paste-buffer, and go through the page first to paste all occurrences of the letter &#331;; then carefully look for wrong accents and other issues.)

<p>I've tried to let the OCR supply the accents, but this was not very successful. Often they might point in the wrong direction. Don't be surprised to see words with both accents. Also don't be surprised to see three vowels in a row (such as in the word <i>n‡‡ala·la</i>, pronounced <i>na-a-ala-ala</i>).

<p>Note that the Tagalog spelling is not always normalized, that is, variations of accent usage do exist, and may very well be intentional, based on the actual pronunciation of the word in context. Also, I've added a lot of words to the good, and a few words to the bad words list. Occurrence on the bad word list does NOT imply that the word is wrong, it just indicates that the word warrants some extra scrutiny.

<p>On many pages, the lines are numbered. Please put those line numbers between braces like this {15} in front of the line. Please do not try to make them align as in the page image, as I will only use them to resolve the index (line-breaks will be different in the HTML and text versions I produce anyway.)

<p>Have fun and Maraming Maraming Salamat for helping with this old text.</BODY></HTML>
